//! The daemon's hourly cleanup. Bridges and reviews delete nothing as they
//! finish: every run's log and folder, a review's files, reviewers' copies
//! and a trial's copy stay, to be looked at, until they're older than their
//! keeping. Each is packed into a `.tar.gz` once it's finished, so an agent
//! that searches files later doesn't come on earlier reviews' findings, and
//! each is named for when it began, which is how old this takes it to be.
//! This clears them once they're past keeping, and packs any finished one
//! that wasn't. Nothing else removes them. Cheap: a look at each folder's
//! names.
